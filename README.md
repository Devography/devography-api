Link To Site: devography.herokuapp.com/

## Programs/Applications Used:

Express
Mongoose
NodeJS
Yarn

## Learning Experience

This was our first project as a team and so we relied heavily upon each other to debug our own problems. We learned a lot about division of labor, project planning, project management, and how to utilize each of our individual strengths. Read documentation!!! Most of the answers are available if you know where and how to search.

## Dynamic API Calls

By creating our own API, the App is able to make dynamic request. For this app, the programming languages endpoint was used. So different props variables were created to make multiple calls.

## Future Directions

- As a user of Devography, I want a search feature that allows me to search either programing languages or paradigm and get a result of different usage. (edited)
